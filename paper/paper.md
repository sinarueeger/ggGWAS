# Summary

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) compute associations between each SNP and a trait of interest. The output of a GWAS is a matrix that contains the summary statistics for each SNP per line. For example the SNP identifier, chromosome, position, effect size, standard error, p-value effect allele, and sometimes the minor allele frequency (ref to gcta). 

A set of model validation steps are performed after the GWAS. One such step is to check the p-value distribution for inflation due to a mispecified GWAS model. This is done by calculating the genomic inflation factor (median...), looking at the Q-Q plot of the p-values and displaying the p-values along the chromosomal position (Manhattan plot). 

While the GWAS computation itself is often done with command line tools (ref), the exploration and validation of the results is done in conventional statistical software, such as R (ref). 

Some of the post-GWAS plots will only be looked at once (e.g. a QQplot), but others (e.g. the Manhattan plot) might become the primary figure of an article. 

Therefore, fast plotting is important, but also versatile plotting (being able to add layers and annotation). 

``ggplot2`` offers such a versatile plotting package. However, ``ggplot2`` is known for its low speed (ref). One reason for this is that a ggplot2 object contains the dataset itself plus adaptations of it. 

With ``ggGWAS`` we propose a ``ggplot2`` extension for GWAS QQplots (`geom_qqplot`) and Manhattan plots (`geom_manhattan`). For  `geom_qqplot` there is additionally a hexagon version that reduces computing time by xx.
